# Improving-Image-Quality-using-SRCNN
Implemented and used a TensorFlow version of the Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network to improve image quality.
I used the all-cnn network ,it can be found at the link : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf

I used the CIFAR-10 dataset and the theano backend for this model.
