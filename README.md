# Ubject recognition using Deep Learning
Used CIFAR-10 object recognition dataset as a benchmark to implement a recently piblished deep neural network.
I used the all-cnn network ,it can be found at the link : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf

I used the CIFAR-10 dataset and the theano backend for this model.
